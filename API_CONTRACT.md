# API Contract

This document outlines the API endpoints for the Snacksy Video Suggester application.

## Endpoint: `/api/suggest_video`

*   **Method:** `POST`
*   **Description:** Accepts a food image, analyzes it using Google Gemini, and returns detected food-related tags.
*   **Request:**
    *   `Content-Type: multipart/form-data`

          "content_type": "string",
          "detected_tags": ["string", "string"]
        }
        ```
    *   **Example (with Gemini-powered tags):**
        ```json
        {
          "filename": "spaghetti.jpg",
          "content_type": "image/jpeg",

*   **Query Parameters:**
    *   `google_id` (string, required): The Google ID of the user. 
        *   *Note: This is a temporary solution for user identification and will be replaced by session/JWT-based authentication in future iterations.*

    *   `Content-Type: application/json`
    *   Body: A JSON array of video objects.

        ```
        *   *Note on `likeCount`*: For videos retrieved via `myRating='like'`, the `likeCount` in the statistics part usually refers to the public like count of the video, not a user-specific value.
    *   **Example Response (Array of videos)**:

    *   Body: A JSON array of recommendation objects. Each object contains `video_id`, `title`, and `reason`.
        (Note: If Gemini couldn't find recommendations or if an error occurs during YouTube activity fetching (which is a soft failure), this could be an empty list `[]`).
    *   **Example Recommendation Object**:
        ```json
        {
            "video_id": "YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID",

        ]

        ```json
        {
            "detail": "Cannot generate recommendations without food tags if YouTube activity is also unavailable."
        }
        ```
    *   **401 Unauthorized**: If issues with user's Google authentication or token refresh during YouTube activity fetching (if `fetch_user_youtube_activity` itself raises this, though it's currently a soft failure in `recommend_video`).

            "detail": "Failed to refresh token: [Error details]. Please re-authenticate."
        }
        ```
    *   **404 Not Found**: If the user specified by `google_id` is not found *and* this leads to an inability to fetch YouTube activity (though this is a soft failure in the current implementation).
        ```json
        {
            "detail": "User or credentials not found. Please authenticate."
        }
        ```
    *   **500 Internal Server Error**: For issues with the Gemini API call or other unexpected server errors.
        ```json
        {
            "detail": "Failed to get recommendations from Gemini: [Specific error message]"
        }
        ```
        ```json
        {
            "detail": "An unexpected error occurred while fetching YouTube activity." 
            // If the soft failure in activity fetching encounters an unexpected error.
        }
        ```
