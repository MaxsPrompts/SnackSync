SnackSync üçïüì∫
Tired of your food getting cold while you search for the perfect YouTube video? SnackSync instantly pairs your meal with the ideal vibe.

Snap a photo of your food, and SnackSync analyzes it‚Äîwhat you‚Äôre eating, where, and when. Then, it taps into your YouTube account to recommend or auto-play the best-matching video: a calming vlog for your morning coffee, a fast-paced mukbang for your takeout, or something educational for your study snack.

The goal: Mood-based content syncing, triggered by your snack, for zero-effort enjoyment.
