SnackSync üçïüì∫

To test locally, you'll need to:

Set up prerequisites: Node.js, Python, PostgreSQL, and Google Cloud credentials (OAuth Client ID with correct localhost URIs, Gemini API key).
Configure .env files in both frontend (with VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, VITE_API_BASE_URL) and backend (with DATABASE_URL, GEMINI_API_KEY, ENCRYPTION_KEY, Google OAuth details if not using client_secret.json directly for all parts).
Run the backend: cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt && uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000.
Run the frontend: cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev.
Then, test each feature: Sign-In, Image Upload & Tagging, YouTube Activity Fetching, and Recommendations. Check browser console and backend terminal for errors.

Tired of your food getting cold while you search for the perfect YouTube video? SnackSync instantly pairs your meal with the ideal vibe.

Snap a photo of your food, and SnackSync analyzes it‚Äîwhat you‚Äôre eating, where, and when.
