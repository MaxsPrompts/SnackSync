Brand Name: SnackSync

Brand Essence: Fun, playful, enthusiastic, and satisfying your cravings with engaging video content.

Color Palette:

Primary Blue: #3A8BCD - This vibrant, slightly desaturated blue is the core brand color, directly inspired by Cookie Monster's fur. It evokes feelings of fun, energy, and approachability.
Accent Light Blue: #80C3F3 - A lighter, brighter shade of blue used for highlights, accents, and interactive elements. It adds a touch of playfulness and visual interest. Think of the lighter tones sometimes seen in Cookie Monster's fur.
Accent Brown: #A0522D - A warm, chocolatey brown representing cookies, of course! This will be used sparingly for key elements that directly relate to snacks or the "munching" aspect.
Neutral Off-White: #F8F8F8 - A clean, light background color to provide contrast and readability.
Neutral Dark Gray: #333333 - Used for body text and important UI elements to ensure clarity and legibility against the lighter backgrounds.
Typography:

Primary Font (Headings & Display): "Bangers" - A bold, playful, and slightly cartoonish font that captures the energetic and fun spirit of Cookie Monster. This will be used for headings, titles, and prominent display text.
Secondary Font (Body Text & UI): "Open Sans" - A clean, readable, and versatile sans-serif font for body text, captions, and user interface elements. Its neutrality ensures readability while complementing the more expressive primary font.
